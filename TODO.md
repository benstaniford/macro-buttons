We should permit dynamic submenus.  These should work by the stdout of the action returning a list of items in JSON.  Python/exe/powershell should all be supported in the same way.

The windows-desktop.json sample should implement two dynamic submenus inside the audio submenu.  It should allow different audio devices to be selected.

We should create a wizard during the installation that allows the samples to be deployed with a checkbox against each one.  There should be a warning on this that existing samples of the same name would be overridden.

We should update the config guide with references and examples of powershell and dynamic submenus.

We should update the Readme.md with mention of the samples and the wizard in the installer.
